    "description": "AWS Security Token Service The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service\nthat enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate\n(federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more\ndetailed information about using this service, go to Temporary Security\nCredentials\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html]. \n\n As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which\nconsist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and\nplatforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient\nway to create programmatic access to STS. For example, the SDKs take care of\ncryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests\nautomatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and\ninstall them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page\n[http://aws.amazon.com/tools/]. \n\nFor information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API,\ngo to Signing AWS API Requests\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html] in\nthe AWS General Reference. For general information about the Query API, go to \nMaking Query Requests\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html] in \nUsing IAM. For information about using security tokens with other AWS products,\ngo to AWS Services That Work with IAM\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html] \nin the IAM User Guide. \n\nIf you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a specific\nAWS product, you can find the product's technical documentation at \nhttp://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ [http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/]. \n\n Endpoints \n\nThe AWS Security Token Service (STS) has a default endpoint of\nhttps://sts.amazonaws.com that maps to the US East (N. Virginia) region.\nAdditional regions are available and are activated by default. For more\ninformation, see Activating and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html] \nin the IAM User Guide.\n\nFor information about STS endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region] in the AWS\nGeneral Reference.\n\n Recording API requests \n\nSTS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for your\nAWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information\ncollected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully made\nto STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about\nCloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS\nCloudTrail User Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html]\n.",

Typically, you use \nAssumeRole for cross-account access or federation. For a comparison of \nAssumeRole with the other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see \nRequesting Temporary Security Credentials\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html] \nand Comparing the AWS STS APIs\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison] \nin the IAM User Guide.\n\n Important: You cannot call AssumeRole by using AWS root account credentials;\naccess is denied. You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to\ncall AssumeRole. \n\nFor cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to\naccess resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each\naccount to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and\nremembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead,\nyou can create one set of long-term credentials in one account and then use\ntemporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming\nroles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see IAM Roles\n(Delegation and Federation)\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html] in the IAM\nUser Guide. \n\nFor federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS\nManagement Console. If you already have an identity and authentication system in\nyour corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS in\norder to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has\nbeen authenticated, you call AssumeRole (and specify the role with the\nappropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials for that user.\nWith those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that\nusers can use to access the console. For more information, see Common Scenarios\nfor Temporary Credentials\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html#sts-introduction] \nin the IAM User Guide.\n\nBy default, the temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole last for\none hour. However, you can use the optional DurationSeconds parameter to specify\nthe duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15\nminutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting\ncan have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value\nfor your role, see View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session] \nin the IAM User Guide. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use\nthe AssumeRole* API operations or the assume-role* CLI operations but does not\napply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more\ninformation, see Using IAM Roles\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html] in the IAM\nUser Guide.\n\nThe temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole can be used to make API\ncalls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS\nservice's GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken APIs.\n\nOptionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose\nnot to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by\nthe operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of the\nrole that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the\ntemporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the\npermissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being\nassumed, and the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict\nthe permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use\nthe passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by\nthe access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see \nPermissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html] \nin the IAM User Guide.\n\nTo assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust\nrelationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created.\nThat trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate access to this\naccount's role. \n\nThe user who wants to access the role must also have permissions delegated from\nthe role's administrator. If the user is in a different account than the role,\nthen the user's administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call\nAssumeRole on the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the\nsame account as the role, then you can either attach a policy to the user\n(identical to the previous different account user), or you can add the user as a\nprincipal directly in the role's trust policy. In this case, the trust policy\nacts as the only resource-based policy in IAM, and users in the same account as\nthe role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more\ninformation about trust policies and resource-based policies, see IAM Policies\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html] in the \nIAM User Guide.\n\n Using MFA with AssumeRole \n\nYou can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when\nyou call AssumeRole. This is useful for cross-account scenarios in which you\nwant to make sure that the user who is assuming the role has been authenticated\nusing an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being\nassumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller\ndoes not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is\ndenied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might\nlook like the following example.\n\n \"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}} \n\nFor more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html] in the \nIAM User Guide guide.\n\nTo use MFA with AssumeRole, you pass values for the SerialNumber and TokenCode \nparameters. The SerialNumber value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA\ndevice. The TokenCode is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA\ndevices produces.",

            "description": "Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID,\na secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use\nis in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of\ndistributed applications inside a corporate network. Because you must call the \nGetFederationToken action using the long-term security credentials of an IAM\nuser, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely\nstored, usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of \nGetFederationToken with the other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see \nRequesting Temporary Security Credentials\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html] \nand Comparing the AWS STS APIs\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison] \nin the IAM User Guide.\n\nIf you are creating a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate\nusers using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or\nan OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider, we recommend that you use Amazon\nCognito [http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/] or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity. For more\ninformation, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity]\n.\n\nThe GetFederationToken action must be called by using the long-term AWS security\ncredentials of an IAM user. You can also call GetFederationToken using the\nsecurity credentials of an AWS root account, but we do not recommended it.\nInstead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy\napplication and then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users\nto only the actions and resources that they need access to. For more\ninformation, see IAM Best Practices\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html] in the IAM\nUser Guide. \n\nThe temporary security credentials that are obtained by using the long-term\ncredentials of an IAM user are valid for the specified duration, from 900\nseconds (15 minutes) up to a maximium of 129600 seconds (36 hours). The default\nis 43200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using\nAWS root account credentials have a maximum duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour).\n\nThe temporary security credentials created by GetFederationToken can be used to\nmake API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:\n\n *  You cannot use these credentials to call any IAM APIs.\n   \n   \n *  You cannot call any STS APIs except GetCallerIdentity.\n   \n   \n\n Permissions \n\nThe permissions for the temporary security credentials returned by \nGetFederationToken are determined by a combination of the following: \n\n *  The policy or policies that are attached to the IAM user whose credentials\n   are used to call GetFederationToken.\n   \n   \n *  The policy that is passed as a parameter in the call.\n   \n   \n\nThe passed policy is attached to the temporary security credentials that result\nfrom the GetFederationToken API call--that is, to the federated user. When the\nfederated user makes an AWS request, AWS evaluates the policy attached to the\nfederated user in combination with the policy or policies attached to the IAM\nuser whose credentials were used to call GetFederationToken. AWS allows the\nfederated user's request only when both the federated user and the IAM user are\nexplicitly allowed to perform the requested action. The passed policy cannot\ngrant more permissions than those that are defined in the IAM user policy.\n\nA typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose credentials are\nused to call GetFederationToken are designed to allow access to all the actions\nand resources that any federated user will need. Then, for individual users, you\npass a policy to the operation that scopes down the permissions to a level\nthat's appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that allows only a\nsubset of permissions that are granted to the IAM user. \n\nIf you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials have\nno effective permissions. The only exception is when the temporary security\ncredentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that\nspecifically allows the federated user to access the resource.\n\nFor more information about how permissions work, see Permissions for\nGetFederationToken\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_getfederationtoken.html]\n.
