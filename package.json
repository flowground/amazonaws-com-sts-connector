    "description": "AWS Security Token Service The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service\nthat enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate\n(federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more\ndetailed information about using this service, go to Temporary Security\nCredentials\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html]. \n\n As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which\nconsist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and\nplatforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient\nway to create programmatic access to STS. For example, the SDKs take care of\ncryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests\nautomatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and\ninstall them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page\n[http://aws.amazon.com/tools/]. \n\nFor information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API,\ngo to Signing AWS API Requests\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html] in\nthe AWS General Reference. For general information about the Query API, go to \nMaking Query Requests\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html] in \nUsing IAM. For information about using security tokens with other AWS products,\ngo to AWS Services That Work with IAM\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html] \nin the IAM User Guide. \n\nIf you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a specific\nAWS product, you can find the product's technical documentation at \nhttp://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ [http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/]. \n\n Endpoints \n\nThe AWS Security Token Service (STS) has a default endpoint of\nhttps://sts.amazonaws.com that maps to the US East (N. Virginia) region.\nAdditional regions are available and are activated by default. For more\ninformation, see Activating and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html] \nin the IAM User Guide.\n\nFor information about STS endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region] in the AWS\nGeneral Reference.\n\n Recording API requests \n\nSTS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for your\nAWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information\ncollected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully made\nto STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about\nCloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS\nCloudTrail User Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html]\n.",
