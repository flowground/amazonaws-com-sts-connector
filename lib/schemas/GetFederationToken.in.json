The final permissions for the federated user are the most restrictive set based on the intersection of the passed policy and the IAM user policy.</p> <p>If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials have no effective permissions. The only exception is when the temporary security credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that specifically allows the federated user to access the resource.</p> <p>The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\\u0020-\\u00FF). It can also include the tab (\\u0009), linefeed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D) characters.</p> <note> <p>The policy plain text must be 2048 bytes or shorter.
